    name: "Culinary History Research"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for students researching the historical
      evolution of French cuisine. Questions should test understanding of how
      culinary practices changed across different periods and chefs, what
      influenced these changes, and how different authors approached similar
      challenges. Focus on synthesis across documents, revealing historical
      context and cultural significance of classical French gastronomy.

  recipe_retrieval:
    name: "Recipe and Technique Retrieval"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test precise retrieval of recipes and
      techniques from classical French cuisine. Questions should target specific
      preparations, cooking methods, or ingredient ratios as documented in these
      texts. Test the ability to extract exact procedural details while
      understanding the terminology and conventions of 19th and early 20th
      century culinary writing in both French and English.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read this cookbook.
      Questions need specific, verifiable answers - exact ingredient amounts,
      particular cooking times, specific recipe names that require the actual
      document. Mix factual recall with procedural understanding and contextual
      interpretation. Test semantic understanding beyond simple keyword matching.
