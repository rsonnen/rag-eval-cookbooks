    You are evaluating whether a document belongs in a corpus of
    HISTORICAL BAKING AND PASTRY COOKBOOKS (1800-1950).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED between 1800 and 1950.
    Modern reprints or facsimiles do NOT belong.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The work must contain ACTUAL BAKING/PASTRY RECIPES with:
    - Ingredient lists with flour, sugar, butter, eggs, etc.
    - Baking instructions/procedures
    - Measurements, temperatures, and techniques

    INCLUDE:
    - Baking-specific cookbooks
    - Pastry and confectionery guides
    - Bread-making manuals
    - Cake decorating books with recipes
    - Candy and confection recipes
    - Professional baker's manuals
    - Dessert-focused cookbooks

    EXCLUDE:
    - General cookbooks with only a few dessert recipes
    - Novels or memoirs
    - Food history without recipes
    - Bakery business guides without recipes
    - Single-page menus or ephemera
    - Scientific treatises on flour/yeast without recipes

    Look for page layouts with baking recipe formatting: ingredient lists,
    mixing instructions, baking times and temperatures, decorating instructions.
