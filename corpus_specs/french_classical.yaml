  validation_prompt: |
    You are evaluating whether a document belongs in a corpus of
    HISTORICAL FRENCH COOKBOOKS (1800-1950).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED between 1800 and 1950. This corpus
    captures classical French cuisine before the nouvelle cuisine revolution.
    Modern reprints, contemporary interpretations, or facsimiles do NOT belong.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The work must contain ACTUAL RECIPES with:
    - Ingredient lists (even if embedded in prose)
    - Cooking instructions/procedures
    - Measurements and techniques

    INCLUDE:
    - French recipe collections and cookbooks
    - Household manuals with significant recipe sections
    - Chef cookbooks and restaurant cuisine guides
    - Regional French cuisine collections
    - Books on French pastry, sauces, and techniques with recipes
    - Menu planning guides with accompanying recipes
    - Translations of French cookbooks into English

    EXCLUDE:
    - Novels or memoirs that merely mention food
    - Restaurant guides or directories without recipes
    - Food history or gastronomy criticism without recipes
    - Nutrition/diet books without actual recipes
    - Travel books with food descriptions but no recipes
    - Single-page menus or ephemera
    - Books primarily about wine without food recipes

    Look for page layouts with recipe formatting: titles, ingredient lists,
    numbered steps, cooking times, serving suggestions.
