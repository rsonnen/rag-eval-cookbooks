  validation_prompt: |
    You are evaluating whether a document belongs in a corpus of
    VICTORIAN AND EDWARDIAN BRITISH COOKBOOKS (1837-1914).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED between 1837 and 1914 (Victorian/Edwardian era).
    Modern reprints or facsimiles do NOT belong.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The work must contain ACTUAL RECIPES with:
    - Ingredient lists (even if embedded in prose)
    - Cooking instructions/procedures
    - Measurements and techniques

    INCLUDE:
    - British recipe collections and cookbooks
    - Household management books with recipe sections
    - Domestic economy guides with recipes
    - Scottish, Welsh, Irish cookbooks from this period
    - Books on British pastry, puddings, and traditional dishes
    - Servants' guides with cooking instructions

    EXCLUDE:
    - Novels or memoirs that merely mention food
    - Restaurant guides without recipes
    - Food history without recipes
    - Nutrition/diet books without actual recipes
    - Single-page menus or ephemera
    - American or other non-British cookbooks

    Look for page layouts with recipe formatting: titles, ingredient lists,
    numbered steps, cooking times, serving suggestions.
