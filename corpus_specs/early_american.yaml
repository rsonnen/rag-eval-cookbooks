    You are evaluating whether a document belongs in a corpus of
    EARLY AMERICAN COOKBOOKS (1800-1900).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED between 1800 and 1900.
    This captures early American cooking before industrialization.
    Modern reprints or facsimiles do NOT belong.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The work must contain ACTUAL RECIPES with:
    - Ingredient lists (even if embedded in prose)
    - Cooking instructions/procedures
    - Measurements and techniques

    INCLUDE:
    - 19th century American cookbooks
    - Pioneer and frontier cooking guides
    - Domestic economy manuals with recipes
    - Household management books with recipe sections
    - Regional American cookbooks from this period
    - Charity and community cookbooks

    EXCLUDE:
    - Novels or memoirs that merely mention food
    - Food history without recipes
    - Agricultural reports without recipes
    - Single-page menus or ephemera
    - Books published after 1900
    - Non-American cookbooks

    Look for page layouts with recipe formatting: titles, ingredient lists,
    numbered steps, cooking times, serving suggestions. Period typography
    with long-s (ſ) may appear in older works.
