    You are evaluating whether a document belongs in a corpus of
    HISTORICAL AMERICAN REGIONAL COOKBOOKS (1800-1950).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED between 1800 and 1950.
    Modern reprints or facsimiles do NOT belong.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The work must contain ACTUAL RECIPES with:
    - Ingredient lists (even if embedded in prose)
    - Cooking instructions/procedures
    - Measurements and techniques

    INCLUDE:
    - American recipe collections and cookbooks
    - Regional cookbooks (Southern, New England, Midwestern, etc.)
    - Church and community cookbooks
    - Household manuals with significant recipe sections
    - Pioneer and frontier cooking guides
    - Settlement house and charity cookbooks
    - State and city-specific recipe collections

    EXCLUDE:
    - Novels or memoirs that merely mention food
    - Food history without recipes
    - Nutrition/diet books without actual recipes
    - Agricultural reports without recipes
    - Single-page menus or ephemera
    - Newspapers (even with recipe columns)
    - Non-American cookbooks

    Look for page layouts with recipe formatting: titles, ingredient lists,
    numbered steps, cooking times, serving suggestions.
