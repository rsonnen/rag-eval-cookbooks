  validation_prompt: |
    You are evaluating whether a document belongs in a corpus of
    HISTORICAL PRESERVING AND CANNING COOKBOOKS (1800-1950).

    TEMPORAL REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
    The work must have been PUBLISHED between 1800 and 1950.
    Modern reprints or facsimiles do NOT belong.

    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    The work must contain ACTUAL PRESERVING/CANNING RECIPES with:
    - Ingredient lists
    - Processing instructions
    - Preservation techniques (canning, pickling, drying, etc.)

    INCLUDE:
    - Canning and preserving manuals
    - Pickle and relish recipe books
    - Jam and jelly making guides
    - Food preservation handbooks
    - USDA canning bulletins
    - Homesteading guides with preservation sections
    - Fruit and vegetable preservation guides

    EXCLUDE:
    - General cookbooks with only a few preserving recipes
    - Novels or memoirs
    - Food science without recipes
    - Agricultural reports without recipes
    - Single-page bulletins or ephemera
    - Commercial food processing manuals

    Look for page layouts with preserving recipe formatting: ingredient lists,
    processing times, canning instructions, storage guidelines.
