name: "Victorian British Cookbooks (1837-1914)"

corpus_context: >
  150 cookbooks published in Britain during the Victorian era (1837-1914),
  sourced from the McGill Library's digitized collection. The collection reflects
  the transformation of British cooking during this period, heavily influenced
  by Mrs. Beeton's "Book of Household Management" and the emerging middle-class
  emphasis on domestic economy and household science. The cookbooks represent a
  blend of refined "drawing room" cooking and economical household management,
  documenting British regional specialties, scientific approaches to cooking,
  elaborate multi-course dining, and practical advice for managing servants and
  households. Content includes detailed multi-step recipes with period-typical
  imprecise measurements, household management guidance, and moral/health advice
  intertwined with culinary instruction.
