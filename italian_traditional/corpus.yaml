    name: "Culinary History Research"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for graduate students researching Italian
      culinary history and food studies. Questions should test understanding
      of how regional cuisines evolved, what ingredients and techniques were
      used in different historical periods, how economic and social conditions
      influenced cooking practices, and how recipes were transmitted across
      generations. Focus on historical context and cultural significance.

  recipe_retrieval:
    name: "Historical Recipe Retrieval"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate whether someone can accurately
      locate and interpret historical recipes. Questions should test ability
      to identify specific ingredients, preparation methods, cooking times,
      regional variations, and the original language/terminology used.
      Focus on precision and completeness - exact quantities, authentic
      terminology, and distinguishing similar but different preparations.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read this cookbook
      versus generating plausible-sounding but incorrect information. Questions
      must have specific, verifiable answers requiring the actual document -
      particular recipe names, exact ingredient lists, specific preparation
      instructions, author commentary, or historical notes. Include details
      impossible to guess or hallucinate.
