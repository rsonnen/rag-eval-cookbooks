name: "Historical Baking and Pastry (1800-1950)"

corpus_context: >
  85 specialized baking and pastry books spanning 1800-1950, covering bread
  making, pastry arts, confectionery, and desserts. Collection includes
  professional baker's manuals, home baking guides, confectioner's handbooks,
  and specialized cake decorating texts. Documents feature precise formulas
  (often using baker's percentages), technical procedures for leavening and
  lamination, sugar work techniques, and equipment specifications from the
  pre-industrial and early industrial eras. Many texts bridge the transition
  from artisan to commercial baking. Sourced from culinary school archives,
  trade publications, and Internet Archive.

  culinary_history:
    name: "Baking History Research"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for researchers studying the history of baking
      and pastry arts. Questions should test understanding of how baking
      techniques evolved, what equipment and ingredients were available in
      different periods, how professional versus home baking differed, and how
      industrialization changed the craft. Focus on technical evolution and
      cultural context.

  recipe_retrieval:
    name: "Baking Formula Retrieval"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test precise retrieval of baking formulas
      and techniques. Questions should target specific ingredient ratios,
      leavening methods, fermentation times, temperatures, and procedural steps.
      Test ability to extract exact measurements (including baker's percentages
      where applicable) and distinguish between similar preparations.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read these baking
      texts. Questions must have specific, verifiable answers - exact formulas,
      precise timing, specific equipment names, and procedural details that
      require the actual document. Baking is particularly precise; test for
      exact proportions and technical details that cannot be approximated.
