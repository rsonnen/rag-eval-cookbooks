name: "Historical Preserving and Canning (1850-1950)"

corpus_context: >
  60 books on food preservation spanning 1850-1950, covering canning, pickling,
  smoking, drying, and other preservation methods. Collection includes USDA
  extension bulletins, commercial canning manuals, home economics textbooks,
  and rural household guides. Documents feature detailed procedures for safe
  food preservation, equipment specifications, timing charts, and recipes for
  preserved goods. Content reflects the evolution from traditional preservation
  methods to modern pressure canning, with strong emphasis on safety practices
  developed after botulism incidents. Sourced from agricultural extension
  archives, USDA historical publications, and Internet Archive.

    name: "Food Preservation History"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for researchers studying the history of food
      preservation in America. Questions should test understanding of how
      preservation techniques evolved, what safety concerns drove changes in
      practice, how home canning related to commercial food production, and
      how government extension services educated the public. Focus on the
      transition from traditional to modern preservation methods.

  recipe_retrieval:
    name: "Preservation Method Retrieval"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test retrieval of specific preservation
      procedures. Questions should target processing times, temperatures,
      pressure levels, ingredient ratios for brines and syrups, and equipment
      specifications. Note that historical methods may differ from modern
      safety standards - test for what the documents actually say, not
      current USDA guidelines.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read these
      preservation texts. Questions must have specific, verifiable answers -
      exact processing times, pressure specifications, brine concentrations,
      and procedural details that require the actual document. Preservation
      is safety-critical; test for precise details that cannot be approximated.
