scenarios:
  culinary_history:
    name: "Culinary History Research"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for researchers studying American food history
      and regional culinary identity. Questions should test understanding of how
      regional cuisines developed, what immigrant influences shaped local
      foodways, how geography and agriculture affected cooking practices, and
      how community cookbooks preserved cultural traditions. Focus on regional
      distinctions and historical context.

  recipe_retrieval:
    name: "Regional Recipe Retrieval"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test retrieval of specific regional recipes
      and their variations. Questions should target particular dishes, local
      ingredient names, regional techniques, and community-specific preparations.
      Test ability to distinguish between regional variants of similar dishes
      and identify authentic historical preparations.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are testing whether a retrieval system actually read these cookbooks.
      Questions need specific, verifiable answers - exact measurements, cooking
      times, ingredient lists, and recipe attributions that require the actual
      document. Focus on details that cannot be fabricated from general knowledge
      of American regional cooking.
